    Step 1: Create a store. src/app/source.js
    Step 2: Create Slice. src/feartures/individualElemnt/elementSlice.js 
        -> Define Initial State
            const InitialState = {
                todos: [{id: 1, text: "Hello World!"}],
                .
                . 
                .
            }
        -> Create Slice using createSlice method.
            const nameSlice = {
                name: "name of slice",
                InitialState,
                reducers: {
                    properties: (state, action)=>{},
                    addTodo: (state, action)=>{
                            State gives the current state
                            Action gives the payload, i.e, values that may come (action.payload)
                        }
                }
            }
        -> export all the individual reducers.      export const {reducer1, reducer2, reducer3, ...} = nameSlice.actions;
        -> export the reducer for store.        export default nameSlice.reducer
    Step 3: Now configure the store, i.e make it aware of reducers.
        -> Import the reducer in store.js 
        -> const store = configureStore({
            reducer: todoReducer
        })
